Now it is necessary to talk about the front of the Xiaomi Mi 6 where what stands out most is the screen,['screen']
There are several reasons that lead us to say this but the two main ones are a memory of 6 GB and a processor Snapdragon 835 with its corresponding Adreno 540,"['memory', 'processor']"
Of this we are not going to talk much since as usual it offers a good amount of personalized options and to our surprise in some occasions they have stayed in memory more than expected,['memory']
350 mAh that has the battery of the terminal,['battery']
We have arrived without problems to a day and a half of use what is not bad considering the processor that integrates there they are noticed the 10 nanometers of technology of manufacture that are used in the Snapdragon 835,['processor']
In addition the screen of which we will speak next,['screen']
With the display on steadily and depending on the brightness the hairpin goes from six hours to peaks of eleven which is quite good,['display']
0 and it's a shame that it's the fourth version getting fill up 50's battery is just a 30 minute question mark but that's in line with the vast majority of the high end of this 2017,['battery']
The screen integrated into the Xiaomi Mi 6 is 5 15 inches with an IPS panel with Full HD resolution,['screen']
Note that here Xiaomi has not put the rest as it has done in the processor and RAM,"['processor', 'ram']"
That yes the speed of work that offers the camera is remarkable as well as the application of control that is complete,['camera']
That yes in some sections as the design or the screen is clearly a step below the most outstanding that we have tested to date,['screen']
That is to say that it complies with the record but without highlighting in excess and even some media range premium is able to offer as little the same level in its screen that offered by the Xiaomi Mi 6,['screen']
As usual in the terminals of Xiaomi it is not possible to extend the storage included in the unit we tested is 64 GB and without being especially fast we have seen better since this component is type UFS 2,['storage']
0 the truth perfectly complies so that no bottleneck occurs when working with the processor and RAM,"['processor', 'ram']"
These are some of the results that we have obtained in the performance tests and that demonstrate that the combination of RAM and the processor of Qualcomm allow to be to the Xiaomi Mi 6 of the best thing that we have seen to date we will see that happens when the OnePlus 5 happens By our hands Summarizing the Xiaomi Mi 6 is a nice phone that does not disappoint and that perfectly meets but does not stand out against models with which it is supposedly facing such as those of Samsung and LG both in our opinion are more attractive and differential,"['ram', 'processor']"
 A five inch screen in a hot  curved metal and glass body,['screen']
 A dual camera with 2x optical zoom,['camera']
 Even the premium model is half the price of a name brand counterpart   we re talking ceramic finish and 18 karat gold plated camera rims,['camera']
 The Mi 6 lost the audio jack in favor of more battery juice  which should have made it easier for Xiaomi to focus on waterproofing,['battery']
 The Mi 6 gained almost 40g  and most of those we can attribute to the sturdy stainless steel frame and the larger battery,['battery']
 The placeholder for the capacitive Home key is almost like carved out of the front screen glass and it does not come with a metal rim as was the case on the Mi 5,['screen']
 Above the screen is the earpiece  which also doubles as a speaker,['screen']
 The 8MP selfie camera is around  a notification LED  and a couple of sensors,['camera']
 Much have changed since the Mi 5  but the display is not among the long list of upgrades,['display']
 We re already used to seeing QHD screens on flagships but on a screen of this diagonal  we re quite content with 1080p as well,['screen']
 You can choose from three different options for the screen s color calibration,['screen']
 When you use the phone in bright light  it would brighten up any dark on screen areas to make them better legible,['screen']
 The Xiaomi Mi 6 has a sealed battery of 3 350mAh,['battery']
0 and the supplied charger can fill up to 55  of a depleted battery in 30 minutes,['battery']
 Our endurance rating stands for how long a single battery charge will last you if you were to use the Xiaomi Mi 6 for an hour each of telephony  web browsing  and video playback daily,['battery']
 We ve established this usage pattern so our battery results are comparable across devices in the most common day to day tasks,['battery']
 The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you re interested in the nitty gritties,['battery']
 You can also check out our complete battery test table  where you can see how all of the smartphones we ve tested will compare under your own typical use,['battery']
 It packs an octa core Kryo 280 processor  4x2,['processor']
9GHz   Adreno 540 GPU  and 6 gigs of RAM in the case of Mi 6,['ram']
 The Snapdragon 835 has one of the most powerful processor to date  sharing the first place with Samsung s Exynos 8895 Octa,['processor']
 It is bested only by the iPhone 7  which runs on even lower 750p screen,['screen']
 Both apps feature on  and off screen tests  and thus give a better understanding of the GPU performance,['screen']
 Finally  we ran BaseMark OS II compound benchmarks   they gauge CPU  GPU  RAM  Web  and OS performance,['ram']
 The Snapdragon 835 chip may not be an equal to the latest Exynos SoC  but having a 1080p screen helped the Mi 6 score better than the Galaxy S8 lineup,['screen']
 It can scan your phone for malware  manage your blacklist  manage or restrict your data usage  configure battery behavior  and free up some RAM,"['battery', 'ram']"
 The Xiaomi Mi 6 comes with a custom Gallery app that shows the camera row by default  but the second tab includes all images and videos on the phone,['camera']
 Now  the Mi 6 is hopping on the dual camera train  but it has swapped the monochrome sensor with a telephoto one,['camera']
 The telephoto camera also does a great job in good light and comes in handy when you need a bit of zoom,['camera']
 Its quality gets close to the main camera s   the images have plenty of detail and the same great processing  colors  and dynamic range,['camera']
 The Mi 6 regular camera has a wide dynamic range  sure  but there are times when you d still want to use the HDR,['camera']
 The stabilization and the wider aperture help the Mi 6 s main camera to produce pleasant pictures with lots of fine detail and natural colors despite the spike in the noise levels,['camera']
 It s not much as we ve seen other phones offer much longer exposure times  but we guess you can download a long exposure camera app from the Play Store if it s badly needed,['camera']
 Just like Apple  Xiaomi wants you to use the telephoto camera only in really good light and mostly for portraits,['camera']
6  the lack of optical stabilization and its smaller sensor  the telephoto camera is probably unfit to capture good low light images,['camera']
 Portrait mode uses the Telephoto camera and some software trickery to create a photo with a faux bokeh   an artificially blurry background resembling the one that occurs naturally when you use a lens with a bright aperture on a large sensor camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
 Its images came out with somewhat duller colors and less contrast  that s how the camera is tuned in this generation   but the pixel peepers will find the bokeh effect to be better,['camera']
 We also tested out the 8MP front facing camera,['camera']
 The new dual camera is the highlight of the package,['camera']
 Even if it doesn t get Mi 5 owners craving for an upgrade though  the latest Snapdragon 835 chip and 6GB of RAM might as well,['ram']
 It s not just design cues that Xiaomi obviously took from Apple   the dual camera and stereo speakers are a direct response to the iPhone 7 Plus,['camera']
15  smartphone with a dual camera and you can take this the wrong way if you re not paying attention,['camera']
 There is obviously a really strong emphasis on the screen size in this statement,['screen']
 So  iPhone  Huawei  and LG   they would laugh at the First Dual Camera statement but Xiaomi clearly wants to have the last laugh by offering those goodies at a fraction of the price,['camera']
 Apple s iPhone 7 Plus was the first to introduce the exact dual camera setup Mi 6 is trying to emulate   and actually succeeding,['camera']
 It has processing power to spare  one of the best designs  a very credible camera  solid battery life  quality stereo sound,"['camera', 'battery']"
 Sure  the display resolution could have been higher  but that would ve hurt performance,['display']
15  screen is reasonably sharp as it is and the 1080p resolution helps squeeze every drop of power out of the Snapdragon 835,['screen']
 The Mi 6 did fine with stabilizing the video  but what we were missing is the really smooth Steadicam like footage  which we get from other flagship camera phones  which combine OIS with some extra digital stabilization,['camera']
 The Mi 6 shoots its portrait shots faster than the iPhone 7   but it takes longer for the camera to read the scene and determine where the depth effect should be,['camera']
 When the light is low and you try to use the 2X camera mode  the Mi 6 will resort to using a digitally zoomed photo from its main camera,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The telephoto lens lacks any kind of stabilization  but you would hardly need it either as when the light gets low  the phone will stop using it and would instead switch to cropping the output of the main camera to achieve the zoomed effect,['camera']
 This  of course  takes its toll on image quality so we d recommend against using the second camera in low light,['camera']
 Overall  the Mi 6 has a flagship worthy camera and processing  and even at 100  magnification nothing got in the way of our positive impressions,['camera']
 The regular wide angle camera on the Mi 6 has a 12MP Sony IMX386 sensor with 27mm f 1,['camera']
 There is no OIS for this camera,['camera']
 The camera interface is fairly simple and features toggles for HDR  Portrait Mode  and flash on the left  and 2x telephoto and the video camera on the right,"['camera', 'camera']"
 The camera also offers quite a few different shooting modes   Panorama  Timer  Audio  Straighten  Manual  Beautify  Group Shot  Tilt Shift  and Night  HHT  as well as the camera settings,"['camera', 'camera']"
 Xiaomi has been playing with different camera sensors  features  and even setups for a while now,['camera']
 The Security app also allows you to define the battery behavior of selected apps and applies restrictions only to the apps you choose,['battery']
 The Wi Fi connection can be used for screen casting   be it Miracast  Google Cast  or DLNA,['screen']
 Still  it lets you hook up USB storage and accessories and charge other devices,['storage']
 We ran our battery test and the Xiaomi Mi 6 scored an 80h rating  which surprisingly is lower than the Mi 5 s rating,['battery']
 The metal rims are reserved for the camera,['camera']
 There are far too many similarities with a certain Cupertino smartphone though   the lack of an audio jack  the added water resistance  the telephoto camera for portrait photography  and the newly introduced stereo speakers,['camera']
 The dual 12MP camera with a telephoto lens and portrait photography is Xiaomi s take on what seems to be the latest fad in phones,['camera']
 The cheapest version of the phone retails for about  365   280 or AU 485 converted  and that model gets you 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 Step it up to the 6GB RAM version with 128GB onboard storage and you ll pay 2 899 Chinese yuan    about  420   330 or AU 560,"['ram', 'storage']"
 One of the Mi 6 s key features is its dual 12 megapixel camera setup  which is a hot trend these days,['camera']
 Qualcomm s Snapdragon 836 processor keeps the Mi 6 buttery smooth,['processor']
 Battery life is superb as well,['battery']
 Selfies came out looking good  but the 8 megapixel Mi 6 s front facing camera ran into the same problems as a lot of other phones when it comes to bad lighting,['camera']
15 inch screen with a 1080 pixel display that looks good to the naked eye,"['screen', 'display']"
 A premium ceramic version with 18K gold finish and 128GB of storage space sells for just a little more at 2 999 Chinese yuan,['storage']
 I love the Mi 6 for what it is    an amazing device with the same speedy processor as the Samsung Galaxy S8  769,['processor']
  The Mi6 s design isn t a huge departure from the Xiaomi Mi5s before it  which means you still get the under glass fingerprint scanner on the home screen that sort of looks like the button fell off  we re not overly keen on it   but it has returned to the glass rear of the Mi5 that was upgraded to aluminium for the 5s,['screen']
 Something that is missing  though  is the headphone jack  which has been swapped out for a USB C port in order to allow space for a higher capacity battery,['battery']
 The Xiaomi Mi5s was fitted with the Sony IMX378  a 12Mp camera also used by the Google Pixel and one that offers very good image quality,['camera']
 The front camera has also been upgraded from 4  to 8Mp  which is plenty clear enough for video chat and selfies,['camera']
 The main differences you ll notice are the lack of an app tray   everything is laid out on the home screen in an iPhone esque fashion   and you ll find some changes in the Settings menu,['screen']
 You can make use of a Quick ball  which places onscreen a shortcut to options such as screenshot and lock  although in common with the one handed mode  which shrinks the size of the screen to a more manageable area  it is more useful for the larger models in Xiaomi s line up   such as the recently announced Mi Max 2,['screen']
 You can view a couple of our test shots in Auto and HDR mode below  though we will be updating this review in the coming weeks once we have had a chance to compare the camera properly with other current flagships,['camera']
 In common with other Xiaomi phones one of these SIM slots can alternatively be used to add a microSD card up to 128GB in capacity  though with internal storage options of 64  and 128GB you may find you don t need one,['storage']
 Also see  How to add storage to Android The Xiaomi supports Bluetooth 5,['storage']
 The Xiaomi features this year s class leading processor   the octa core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835   but while its rivals pair this chip with 4GB of DDR4 RAM Xiaomi specifies 6GB,"['processor', 'ram']"
 Our photo black review sample looks very much like a smaller version of the Mi Note 2  but with the camera   sorry  cameras   found flush to the frame in the top left corner,['camera']
 This is not the first Xiaomi to feature a dual camera  the Redmi Pro also had one   but it is the first dual camera Xiaomi flagship,"['camera', 'camera']"
 This is not a screen you d find yourself complaining about,['screen']
 With increasing screen resolutions also comes increasing demands placed on the battery  of course  and this is a standout area for the Mi6  fitted as it is with a 3 350mAh cell that supports Quick Charge  but not wireless charging  and may even keep going two days,"['screen', 'battery']"
 So the full HD screen is a trade off we re more than happy to make   especially when that display is as bright  1  to 600 nits  and vibrant as this one  with great contrast  realistic colours and excellent viewing angles,"['screen', 'display']"
15in screen  features very slim screen bezels  and is just 7,"['screen', 'screen']"
 As manufacturers look to differentiate themselves on screen size and quality  with flagships that get larger with every new release  Xiaomi is sticking to its ground,['screen']
 Our photo black Xiaomi Mi6 is the  International  edition with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 There s also a version with 128GB storage  neither support expansion via microSD  though few people would find themselves low on space at this capacity  and a ceramic model with the same 18K gold detailing as seen on the revolutionary Mi Mix,['storage']
 Also see  Best Android phones 2017  A clear contender for snatching the crown for best Chinese phone  the successor to the Mi5 and Mi5s takes on design aspects from the Mi Note 2  adds a dual camera and forward facing features such as USB C audio  and tops it all off with faster performance than anything we ve seen yet,['camera']
 While Samsung s still debating whether to add a dual camera or under glass fingerprint scanner to its Galaxy line  Xiaomi s already done it,['camera']
 And though it might lack the Quad HD Infinity Display and curved glass edges  the Xiaomi has a great screen and is a much more comfortable size to hold in one hand,"['display', 'screen']"
 Not only was the Mi 5 affordable  beautiful  and packed with top tier features  it was also one of the first devices to sport Qualcomm s Snapdragon 820 processor,['processor']
 Below the display  you ll find a set of capacitive back and recent apps keys  which flank the physical home button,['display']
 Despite being a flagship device  the Mi 6 does fall behind the pack a bit with its 1080p display,['display']
 Aside from the Galaxy S8 and HTC U11  the Mi 6 is one of the first devices to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor,['processor']
 It also comes with either 4 or 6 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of on board storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 As I alluded to earlier  the ceramic edition is considered the most premium of the bunch  as it comes with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage,"['ram', 'storage']"
 The biggest issue I ran into when reviewing the Mi 6 is assessing battery life  as the phone was only connected to T Mobile via HSPA,['battery']
 Some extra features include a Dual App mode that allows multiple iterations of the same application  a Deep Clean application that helps to clear the phone of junk files  and included Mi Cloud storage if you have a Mi account,['storage']
 That s definitely true for the camera  which is a dual lens system that provides a 2x optical zoom aside the original wider angle,['camera']
 The camera software in the Mi 6 provides a few extra modes that shutterbugs will be particularly fond of  including a Pro mode,['camera']
 And even as an automatic shooter  the Mi 6 s camera is quick enough to take a good shot  even when shooting in HDR mode,['camera']
 That is  until you use the marquee feature of the Xiaomi Mi 6 camera   Portrait Mode,['camera']
 This is only really noticeable when zooming in  taken on their own  the portrait photos turned out to be the most enjoyable part of the camera experience,['camera']
 Lower light situations make these and pretty much any other photo suffer especially in the finer details of the pictures  making this a less than ideal indoor or nighttime camera,['camera']
 The dual speaker is a bit reserved  the battery is big but sacrifices the headphone jack  and the dual camera isn t as capable as we would like,"['battery', 'camera']"
 In Android Authority s own battery testing app  the Mi 6 was able to achieve about seven hours of continuous screen on usage using a mixture of gaming  browsing  and video playback,"['battery', 'screen']"
 In my personal usage  I was able to get close to six hours of screen on time primarily on my home Wi Fi network,['screen']
0 helped keep the Mi 6 s battery topped off throughout the day,['battery']
 Overall I didn t have any issues with the display  though sometimes I did have trouble finding the brightness slider in dark environments,['display']
 Trust me  this display gets really dark when the slider is turned all the way down,['display']
 Though it is a controversial move  Xiaomi says removing it allowed them to include a bigger 3 350 mAh battery,['battery']
  The Xiaomi Mi6 is available in three different color variants  black  blue and silver  and a black ceramic version with golden adornments around the camera lens,['camera']
 Not only has the screen diagonal of the Mi6 remained the same compared to the predecessor  but all the dimensions of the device are almost identical,['screen']
 The edges around the IPS display are a little large for our tastes,['display']
 At barely 72   the Mi6 has a considerably more inefficient display surface ratio than the 2017 high end competition  the LG G6 or the Samsung Galaxy S8,['display']
1 storage of our test unit has a capacity of 64 GB  with only 51,['storage']
 The storage of the dual SIM smartphone cannot be extended,['storage']
 The main camera in the back of the Mi6 has a Sony Exmor RS sensor with a resolution of 12 MP in the 4 3 format  3968x2976 pixels ,['camera']
 The camera module has a focal distance of 27 mm   1,['camera']
 The second camera on the back also has a resolution of 12 MP,['camera']
 The 12 MP camera records videos in a 4K maximum resolution at 30 FPS,['camera']
  The capacitive multi touchscreen reacts quickly and reliably up to the display edges,['display']
 As already in the Mi5  the IPS display of the Mi6 offers a Full HD resolution of 1920x1080 pixels in a 5,['display']
 Whether in a 2017 high end smartphone with this display size  a WQHD resolution  2560x1440 pixels  is necessary  is a matter of taste,['display']
  The combination of display brightness and a black value of 0,['display']
 While the speaker above the display has a volume that is slightly lower and rather conveys the highs  the speaker at the bottom of the device is louder and also more powerful,['display']
  The built in battery is rated at 3350 mAh,['battery']
0 support  if the battery is empty  it is quickly charged again,['battery']
 The display  storage  technical equipment  connectivity  and the battery life have improved,"['display', 'storage', 'battery']"
 The camera continues to remain an issue where we see room for improvement  although the dual camera is by no means bad,"['camera', 'camera']"
 Of course there are also minor complaints  such as the slightly high deviations in the color and grayscale display of the IPS panel  the weight that is quite high  the missing IP certification  or the unsupported Qi standard for wireless charging,['display']
 The internal storage also cannot be expanded,['storage']
 There are no long load times or stutters  and apps also close quickly due to the fast UFS storage,['storage']
  The display analysis with a photo spectrometer and the CalMAN software shows quite high deviations of the color  4,['display']
8  and grayscale display  5,['display']
 Moreover  the display s color temperature of 7473 Kelvin is slightly too cool  which results in a slight blue tint in practice,['display']
  At a very low brightness level  from 20  on we could measure screen flickering in a quite high frequency of 2315 Hz,['screen']
 Navigation is done with two illuminated capacitive keys below the display and a touch sensitive home button that has an integrated active fingerprint scanner,['display']
  As with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus  the Xiaomi Mi6 offers a two times optical zoom and a dual camera mode with Bokeh effects for pictures,['camera']
 In bright lighting conditions  the two camera modules ensure very sharp pictures rich in detail,['camera']
 The Sony IMX268 image sensor of the front camera has a resolution of 8 MP,['camera']
 The front camera records videos in Full HD resolution  1920x1080 pixels  at up to 30 images per second,['camera']
 The 3350 mAh battery is charged via USB 3,['battery']
 The wireless transfer of the display contents to an external monitor via Miracast is also supported and worked well in our test with an Android TV by Sony,['display']
 To supply the power  a 3350 mAh battery is built in  which gives us hope for a very good battery life considering the display size,"['battery', 'battery', 'display']"
 Inside the dual SIM smartphone a Snapdragon 835  which is currently the most powerful processor by Qualcomm  provides the necessary performance,['processor']
 Furthermore  there are 6 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of UFS 2,['ram']
1 memory,['memory']
 For the first time  Xiaomi has built a dual camera system into one of their flagship devices,['camera']
 The second camera module on the back of the device collects depth information which provides the photos with the so called Bokeh effect,['camera']
 The manufacturer s top model has 128 GB of internal storage and a ceramic back    520 Euros    582  it currently costs around  600 in the US ,['storage']
 The glass model is also available with a 128 GB of memory for an extra charge of about 70 Euros    78 ,['memory']
Regarding the design of the terminal we have finished in metal and glass in this version of 64GB storage with three possible colors black white and violet while the 128GB Exclusive version is finished in ceramic as we saw in the previous Mi5 and is exclusively Black with the lenses rim of both chambers in gold,['storage']
The screen is an IPS in resolution FULL HD 1920x1080 which gives 428 dpi of density a screen of very good quality looks good in the sun the colors are very natural nothing saturated we could attribute in any case to Xiaomi that has not opted for a higher resolution Thing that already do their competitors in the high ranges with resolutions 2K but do not forget that we are before a device of 5,"['screen', 'screen']"
The star point of the new Xiaomi Mi6 is the addition of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with the Adreno 540 GPU and 6GB of RAM leaving about 4GB,['ram']
This is a 10 nm processor in which Qualcomm has wanted to seek the maximum power compensated with a balanced battery consumption which has achieved,"['processor', 'battery']"
The Xiaomi Mi6 does not disappoint in the photographic section at the back with its double camera Xiaomi incorporates a Sony main sensor IMX386 12MP with aperture f 1,['camera']
8 and a secondary sensor from Samsung the camera takes advantage of these two sensors to have a optical zoom of 2X,['camera']
As for video we have slow-motion recording at 120fps to 720 and recording in fullHd and 4K at 30fps has no option to record at 60fps the front camera also allows to record video up to FullHD,['camera']
The application of the well-known camera for Xiaomi users with the options Rustico Color Pop Glacial filters,['camera']
HDR and change cameras directly on the screen within the mode menu we find the audio options panorama view and enable manual mode where we can play with the parameters of the camera,"['screen', 'camera']"
We find a 3350mAh Li Polymer battery non-removable as it is a unibody terminal with quick charge Quick Charge 3,['battery']
The Xiaomi Mi6 has impressed us the first test I've gone through is to let you play video on YouTube with the brightness to the maximum giving me results of more than 7 hours of screen,['screen']
An excellent terminal if you want to power battery a decent daytime camera a good sound and do not look for a big screen the Xiaomi Mi6 is your mobile,"['battery', 'camera', 'screen']"
The charge from 0 to 100 has done in an hour and a half also a good time to be able to have a battery for a while as it usually happens faster charging at the beginning than the final part of the battery,"['battery', 'battery']"
It allows Wifi Display you could have seen in the game test video that was broadcasting to the TV without problem,['display']
0 protocol update allowing connection to longer distances less battery consumption and bandwidth improvement at 2 Mbit s,['battery']
The storage as we have already discussed is 64GB there is a higher version of 128GB does not have MicroSD storage slot with 64GB for the vast majority will be enough but if you need more space you will need to buy the 128GB,"['storage', 'storage']"
The front in the lower in addition to the touch button with the fast and accurate reader with about 30 attempts in a row with only a couple of failures to not put very well the finger has two led for the other two buttons that light up when using the mobile And on the top the front camera the speaker and the mono notification led white color together with the proximity sensor,['camera']
At the back we have the Xiaomi logo dual led dual-flash and dual camera,['camera']

 "On paper, the G6 doesn't have as powerful a processor and as long-lasting a battery. LG fans will also be disappointed that said battery is no longer removable (then again, neither is the S8's). And while earlier LG was set to announce its big-screen, small-bezel phone, Samsung's S8 takes the same basic idea and adds more elegance with a unique curved-edge twist";https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-g6/review/
;
"The sharp, 5.7-inch screen takes up roughly 80 percent of the front of the phone, leaving it with an impressively thin bezel all around. It's unique in that it has an 18:9 aspect ratio (with the exception of the S8, most phones are 16:9)";https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-g6/review/
;
"In addition to its beautifully glossy design and screen, the G6 is dust- and water-resistant like the S8s, the Apple iPhone 7s and several Sony Xperia phones. It's rated IP68, so you can dunk it in up to 4.9 feet of water (about 1.5 meters) for up to 30 minutes. For the everyday user though, it just means the G6 won't crap out after you accidentally drop it in the pool or spill coffee on it. (Get a deeper dive on IP ratings and what they mean for waterproof gadgets.) I dunked it in a fishbowl and a bucket of water and let it sit each time underwater for 30 minutes. I also placed it inside a shower with the water splashing on it for 30 minutes. In all three instances, the handset kept ticking fine afterward, and it even registered an incoming call during the full dunking";https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-g6/review/
;
"With that said, waterproofing and removable batteries don't tend to go together these days, so the fact that the G6 does not have a removable battery was kind of a given. Still, to longtime LG fans, this might come as a disappointment. After the LG G2 in 2013, the company has been one of the few holdouts to feature swappable batteries in its flagship phones, so people can switch a drained one for a charged one or replace an old battery with a fresh one";https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-g6/review/
;
"The Galaxy S8($769.00 at Amazon.com) doesn't have a removable battery either. Samsung's flagships ditched that years ago. Its 3,000mAh battery clocked an average of 16 hours of drainage time. Samsung also said the overall life expectancy of the S8's battery life will last longer as well, years down the road";https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-g6/review/
;
"The LG G6 Plus has extra storage -- 128GB up from 32GB on the standard model -- plus support for high-resolution audio through the headphone jack and B&O Play headphones in the box. It's not a major overhaul, but power users will no doubt be grateful of the storage boost";https://www.cnet.com/news/lg-unveils-128gb-g6-plus-adds-bonus-features-to-the-g6/
;
"On the G6, you can switch between the standard 13-megapixel lens and the 120-degree wide-angle lens to capture more content in each frame. If you're really all about that wide-angle life, the 5-megapixel front-facing shooter has a wide-angle option as well";https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-g6/review/2/
;
"Unless you want to be on the absolute edge of technology, the idea of being saddled with ""last year's"" processor shouldn't be a huge deal, and the advantages of the 835 aren't that dramatic on paper. In the real world, the usual differences between one superfast processor and another are hardly discernible. During my time with the G6, it was smooth and fast. Apps launched and quit promptly, the camera operated quickly and the display was responsive";https://www.cnet.com/products/lg-g6/review/2/
;
"While it might seem logical to launch the G7 at CES to get a better head start on the Galaxy S9, that advantage will be largely lost if LG can’t get the G7 on shelves faster than it got the G6 out. An MWC launch would provide more preparation time, more mobile media attention and, if LG can get the phone out sooner rather than later, still lure plenty of customers in well before the Galaxy S9 becomes a real possibility";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g7-lg-v30-accelerated-launch-780022/
;
"Yet, there is one way the LG G6 is different; its 5.7-inch screen with a unique 18:9 aspect ratio. With other phones expected to also offer the same aspect ratio display later this year, the G6 could prove to be a forward-thinking phone rather than yet another one-hit wonder from LG";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
;
"Unlike previous G-series flagships, the LG G6 features a unibody design, which unfortunately means the company had to forego the removable battery this time around. It’s a small tradeoff for what you get in return, though – an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
;
"On the top of the device, you’ll find a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, which LG plans on keeping for the foreseeable future as the benefits outweigh removing it. The bottom of the device houses the USB Type-C port and a single speaker, and the right side features the SIM card slot. The volume keys can be found on the left of the device, and not on the back flanking the rear-mounted power button. LG toyed with placing the power button/volume keys on the back panel of its devices for a few years, but it looks like that experiment has come to a close";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
;
"The standout feature on the LG G6 is the new 18:9 2:1-aspect ratio screen, which, coupled with some excellent design choices, means LG has managed to fit a 5.7-inch display in a body that’s not much larger than a regular 5.2-inch phone. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel XL, the LG G6 is significantly smaller. It’s truly a feat of engineering that is much easier to appreciate when you hold and use the phone";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
;
"Ahead of the launch of the LG G6, we heard rumors that LG would opt for last year’s Snapdragon 821 processor rather than the new Snapdragon 835, mainly as the latter would require the launch to be delayed several months. As a result, the LG G6 comes equipped with the Snapdragon 821 processor alongside 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU, which is the same package found in the OnePlus 3T and Google’s Pixel XL, the former being the handset we crowned the best smartphone of 2016!";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
;
"The LG G6 comes equipped with 32GB of storage in most markets, which is expandable by up to 2TB using a microSD card slot. Additional connectivity features include Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, NFC and in some markets, an FM radio. The USB Type-C port is v3.1 compliant and supports USB On-The-Go, meaning you can connect a hard drive or USB stick using a compatible adapter (which isn’t included in the box)";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
;
"The LG G6 camera has also had a little upgrade this year but it’s not quite what you may have expected; rather than the customary boost in megapixels or pixel size, LG has opted to reduce the regular camera from 16MP to 13MP and boost the wide-angle camera to the same 13MP resolution. Doing so has meant they can also remove the camera bump, resulting in a camera that’s flush with the rest of the body";http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/
